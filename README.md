## Star Trek Fleet Command Server 82

Here you will find general information about the server including RoE (Rules of Engagement) and how to engage with the community.

But first, we have to write that up. So sit tight.

## Rules of Engagement

These Rules of Engagement discuss when it is or is not okay to go PvP.

This is a living, breathing, evolving document. These will be updated as discussions happen.

### Standard RoE

These default rules apply at all times and in all systems, unless covered by a specific exception in the section below.

* Survey ships are &#x1F534; INVALID TARGETS unless:
  * They are OPC, OR
  * They are sitting on a zeroed node
    * Before attacking a survey ship on a zeroed node, you MUST send a DM to the player informing them of the reason for the attack.
    * No warning/grace period is required between DM and attack, but waiting 1-2 minutes is often appreciated, as the player may not have even been aware of the problem.
* Warships are &#x1F7E2; VALID TARGETS at all times unless:
  * They are participating in an Armada
* Stations may be raided at any time.
  * Poaching resources from a raid you did not participate in is not allowed, and considered a violation of these RoE.
  * OPC survey ships recalling from a raid are &#x1F7E2; VALID TARGETS

### Exceptions

#### Swarm Space

* Active warships are &#x1F534; INVALID TARGETS
* Idle warships are &#x1F7E2; VALID TARGETS
  * Before attacking an idle warship in swarm space, you must send a warning message and wait at least one minute

#### Borg Space

* Active warships are &#x1F534; INVALID TARGETS
* Idle warships are &#x1F7E2; VALID TARGETS
  * Before attacking an idle warship in Borg space, you must send a warning message and wait at least one minute

#### Territories

* If your alliance controls the territory, your warships and OPC miners are &#x1F7E2; VALID TARGETS. All others ships are &#x1F534; INVALID TARGETS
* If your alliance does not own the territory, all of your ships are &#x1F7E2; VALID TARGETS
* During takeover events, all ships are &#x1F7E2; VALID TARGETS

### Enforcement

If you believe that another player has attacked you in violation of RoE, you should first send them a message inquiring about the incident. If they do not respond, or you do not believe that their response is sufficient, you should contact the admiral of your alliance.

Consequences TBD.
