## Star Trek Fleet Command Server 82

Here you will find general information about the server including RoE (Rules of Engagement) and how to engage with the community.

But first, we have to write that up. So sit tight.

## Rules of Engagement

These Rules of Engagement discuss when it is or is not okay to go PvP.

This is a living, breathing, evolving document. These will be updated as discussions happen.

* Survey ships are OFF LIMITS unless:
  * They are OPC, OR
  * They are sitting on a zeroed node
    * Before attacking a survey ship on a zeroed node, you MUST send a DM to the player informing them of the reason for the attack.
    * No warning/grace period is required between DM and attack, but waiting 1-2 minutes is often appreciated, as the player may not have even been aware of the problem.
* Warships are FAIR GAME at all times unless:
  * They are participating in an Armada, OR
  * ...TBD
* Stations may be raided at any time.

### Enforcement

If you believe that another player has attacked you in violation of RoE, you should first send them a message inquiring about the incident. If they do not respond, or you do not believe that their response is sufficient, you should contact the admiral of your alliance.

Consequences TBD.
